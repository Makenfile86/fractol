# fractol
//

This is a 42 school project.

The object was to create a program that showcases different kinds of 3D fractals. You had to use the minilibx graphics library to archieve this. There needed to be atleast three different types of fractals. including the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
It had to be possible to make the parameter of the Julia set vary only with the mouse (without clicking).
The mouse wheel should zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the computer).
